\subsection{Methods}

We collaboratively wrote the article in LaTeX (\href{http://www.latex-project.org/}{latex-project.org}) using the online authoring platform Authorea (\href{https://www.authorea.com}{authorea.com}).
Furthermore, we tracked the development of the document using Git and GitHub.
The Git repo is available at \href{https://github.com/jdblischak/git-for-science}{github.com/jdblischak/git-for-science}, and the rendered LaTeX article is available at \href{https://www.authorea.com/users/5990/articles/17489}{authorea.com/users/5990/articles/17489}.
