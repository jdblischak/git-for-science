\subsection{Share your code}

Once you have a directory of version controlled files, referred to as a repository, you can share it with your collaborators and the wider scientific community by putting your code online.
This is made easier if you use one of the many online services that host Git repositories (Table x), e.g. GitHub.

To begin using GitHub, you'll first need to sign up for an account.
For the examples in this tutorial, we'll use the fake username "scientist123".
Next you'll need to choose the option to "Create a new repository".
We'll call it "thesis" because that is the directory name containing the files, but this is not a requirement.
Also, now that the code will be existing in multiple places, we need to learn some more terminology.
A local repository refers to code that is stored on the machine you are using, e.g. your laptop; whereas, a remote repository refers to the code that is hosted online.
Thus we have just created a remote repository.

Now we need to send the code on our computer to GitHub.
The key to this is the URL that GitHub assigns your newly created remote repository.
It will have the form \verb|https://github.com/username/reponame.git|, e.g. \verb|https://github.com/scientist123/thesis.git|.
We'll tell Git about our remote repository using the command \verb|git remote add|.
We use the alias name "origin" so that we don't have to type out the full URL in the future (this is the traditional name for a remote repository, but you could use another name if you liked).

\begin{lstlisting}
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/scientist123/thesis.git
\end{lstlisting}

We send our code to GitHub using the command \verb|git push|.

\begin{lstlisting}
$ git push origin master
\end{lstlisting}

We first specify the remote repository, "origin", followed by the name of the branch name "master".
Branches are parallel versions of the code, but we will not cover them in depth in this tutorial (Box 3).
As we have seen, we can already accomplish a lot when only using one branch.

Pushing to GitHub also has the added benefit of backing up your code in case anything were to happen to your computer.
Also, it can be used to sync your code across multiple machines, similar to a service like Dropbox, but with the added control of Git.
For example, let's say we wanted to work on our code on our computer at home.
We can download the Git repository using the command \verb|git clone|.

\begin{lstlisting}
$ git clone https://github.com/scientist123/thesis.git
\end{lstlisting}

By default, this will download the Git repository into a local directory named "thesis".
Furthermore, the remote "origin" will automatically be added so that you can easily push your changes back to GitHub.
