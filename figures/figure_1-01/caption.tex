\textbf{Figure 1. The git add/commit process.} To store a snapshot of changes in your repository, first \verb|git add| any files to the staging area you wish to commit (for example, you've updated the \verb|process.sh| file). Second, type \verb|git commit| with a message. Only files added to the staging area will be committed. All past commits are located in the hidden \verb|.git| directory in your repository.
