\textbf{Figure 3. Contributing to Open Source Projects.} You found an error in the README for a cool project hosted on Github and you would like to fix it. A) The cool\_project repository exists on Github (along with the commit history of the project), but you would like to edit the README on your computer. B) First, you fork the cool\_project repository into your account on Github, bringing the entire commit history of the project along with the code. C) To create a copy of the repository on your computer, you \verb|git clone| the repository from your Github account. D) You make a change to the README, save the file, add the file to the staging area, and commit (creating commit ID 09pr4). This commit is only on your local computer and your remote cool\_project repository and the original remote cool\_project repository do not have this commit. E) You sync your local and remote repositories by using \verb|git push|. The original cool\_project still does not have your update to the README file. F) To suggest the change in the README to the original cool\_project team, submit a pull request via Github of your commits. If the owners of the cool\_project repository like your change, they will accept the pull request and your changes will be incorporated into the project.
